==========
Leave page
==========

The *Leave* page, ``leave.html``, is in the **groups**
context. It is necessary for this page to be outside the
**group** context, otherwise the former member would get a
*Permission Denied* **after** he or she left a *secret* group.

Rather than simply providing a button that removes the member
from the group, the *Leave* page presents the user a choice for
reducing the amount of email. The hypothesis is that members
often leave because they get overwhelmed by email. Giving the
member the choice of going onto *Topics digest* or *Web only* may
reduce the numbers leaving.
